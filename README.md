## About

The VOO Stock Prediction Project leverages advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the stock price movements of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). By integrating sentiment analysis with historical price data through LSTM networks and ARIMA models, our goal is to offer a robust tool for investors seeking to make informed decisions in the stock market.

## Project Overview

This project was conceived to address the need for more accurate and reliable stock price predictions in the rapidly changing financial market. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, representing a broad swath of U.S. equities, serves as an excellent benchmark for this endeavor. Our analysis spans from [01/03/2021] to [31/03/2024], covering diverse market conditions.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of social media to gauge market sentiment.
- Time series forecasting with LSTM networks tailored for stock price data.
- ARIMA model implementation for comparison and integration with LSTM predictions.
- Detailed performance evaluation and insights generation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Multivariate Exploration**
- **Closing Price & Moving Averages**
- **Daily Returns & Volatility**
- **Seasonality Analysis**
- **Day of the Week Effects**
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Analysis**

## Data Sources
- Historical Price Data: Sourced from Yahoo Finance
- Sentiment Data: Collected from Reddit

## Conclusion

- In evaluating predictive models for VOO price dataset, the **ARIMA model** demonstrates superior performance over LSTM based on MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and RÂ² metrics. 

- However, **LSTM** shows potential for improvement with extended training data, possibly outperforming ARIMA. By increasing the number of days we base our prediction on to N_PRED_DAYS = 100, the accuracy improved, resulting in a better fit curve and decreased uncertainty.

- Additionally, **sentiment analysis** via FinBERT provides valuable insights into market sentiment's role alongside historical data in predicting stock prices. Integrating sentiment analysis with predictive models can offer a more comprehensive approach to stock price prediction, acknowledging the multidimensional nature of financial markets.
