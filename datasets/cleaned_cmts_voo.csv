NativeTxn7,kwwq3xp,2024-03-28,/r/ETFs/comments/1bpdnmd/schg_schd_vs_voo/kwwq3xp/,"No way to know honestly, Large growth has had a huge run over the last 3-5 years, but there is no way to know for sure if that will continue, and if it does, for how long. There is a LOT of recency bias out there right now and people are thinking that these huge tech names can't miss, but again, there is no way to know exactly what the future holds. If you go back over the historical records, value and growth have taken turns outpacing the other over various periods. Growth has been superior over the last 5-10 years.

To a certain extent, I would argue that VOO is currently a proxy for a tech fund anyway, but you get some additional diversification over a pure tech fund.

I mean, if you look at VOO, you have MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, GOOG, and AVGO making up 8 of the top 10 holdings and accounting for 29.07% of the entire S&P 500. TSLA sits at #11 and would make that total about 30.37% in just 9 out of 500 holdings.

So, it's already pretty heavily concentrated in ""tech"" - not as heavily concentrated as something like SCHG, but still plenty of exposure.

At the end of the day, if you'd tilted toward SCHG in a 60/40 or 65/35 split over the last decade or so, you'd be better off than having been in VOO (though VOO would have still done very well).

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

So, if you are confident that growth will continue to outperform, then tilting toward growth makes sense.

The hardest thing about ""tilting"" is when your tilts are not working in your favor. Let's say that you tilted 65/35 growth/value and starting tomorrow value outperformed growth for the next 5 years, would you have the discipline to stick with the tilt so that when things switch back to growth outpacing value you'll get that benefit.

There will be a lot of people telling you that you're really young and to concentrate your holdings into growth. But as I said, there's a tremendous amount of recency bias coupled with assumptions about ""tech not going anywhere"" type of thinking about things moving forward that are leading people to those conclusions.

Bottom line, you'll likely be fine with whatever path you choose as long as you stick with your plan and keep putting money in through ups and downs.",3,ETFs

Glass-Lifeguard1919,kx05syd,2024-03-28,/r/ETFs/comments/1bq2hk5/voo_vgt_vti/kx05syd/,"There are several reasons why you want SCHD in a portfolio.

1. SCHD invests in safer & more stable stocks, so the floor is lower in bear markets.
2. Diversification is another reason. VOO & SCHD only have an 8% overlap meaning they compliment each other well.
3. Another reason is capital gains taxes. When you get ready to retire, at least for the majority of us, we aren't going to be able retire on 1.4% dividends. So you will have to sell your VOO to buy into stocks like SCHD when you do get ready to retire. Depending on how much you sell 150-300k in taxes could be likely, and thats not even taking into cosideration that the gov raises cap gains.
4. Dividend appreciation. SCHD increases its dividends every year, so if you get a base position now... in 20-30 years like you are suggesting, your APY on cost might be something like 25-30%. You'd just have to do the math on the dividend appreciation. Look at what Warren Buffett gets paid every year from just holding KO for 30 years... I personally want to be able to live off dividends so I can pass the original capital investment on to my children. SCHD gets those dividends appreciating.",10,ETFs

I would spread your risk more. International (IEFA), large growth (which you have with SCHG, I use VUG), technology (XLK, SMH), home construction (ITB), S & P 500 (VOO, you have this). I found the only reliable stocks for growth are Visa and Mastercard as cash is used increasingly less. I agree with the other poster to stay away from small caps. For pure growth as you have a long time line, I would say my portfolio is superior.....try to put your 3 funds against my 8 funds on portfoliovisualizer.com. You get better returns and more dividends.

Fund overlap with slight differences in distribution can be used as a tool in portfolio creation.  VTI would also give you some exposure to small and mid while still heavily weighted in the S&P.  VT with its almost 10000 holdings would be the next evolution in that thought process; still heavy in S&P while slightly increasing exposure to mid, small, and international.  That said I am of the opinion over time the S&P will outperform.  If you do sell Id suggest SPY; its greatest strength is its liquidity and if you’re long that’s less of a benefit.  Subsequently the spread would be better on the sale and VOO has a better expense ratio.  That said I wouldn’t be in a rush to sell.  If you find yourself ahead of the tax man then the sale could be an opportunity for tax loss harvesting.

If you have earned income, you should start investing in an IRA, and if you exceed that, open a brokerage account.

Under the buy conditions just select ""market order"", select ""dollars"" and just enter the amount of cash in your account. It will then buy as many shares as possible at the current bid/ask spread with the amount of dollars you offered up. Fidelity does fractional shares, so you will be able to get partial cost bases to utilize a maximal amount of your cash.

Those fund managers Vanguard have 10 year forecasts for US equity vs International equity and I think US was around 4% and Intl was like 7% annualized.

Regardless, since we are emotional beings, and emotions are detrimental to long term returns, you have to have very high level of conviction to stick with one strategy for the long term. Some people decide that market cap weighted passive investing is the best way to take the emotion out of investing. This would be close to 60/40 VTI/VXUS. Others look for factors to maximize risk adjusted rate of return. Others prefer active managers while still being sufficiently diversified across company size, location, sector, and quality. These are sensible options to me since you have concrete rules to how the portfolios are constructed. Going with arbitrary weightings like 80/10/10 is likely going to make you change your mind when one of the positions is under performing for several years, especially since s&p500 is all large cap domestic equities, heavily concentrated in the technological sector.

NativeTxn7,kxq0h8b,2024-04-02,/r/ETFs/comments/1bu3l1e/spy_or_voo_or_does_it_matter/kxq0h8b/,"SPY has much higher volume, so use it if you are trading it or using options with it. If you're just buying and holding for the long-run, go with VOO, IVV, or SPLG.

All 4 of these track the S&P 500, but VOO, IVV, and SPLG all cost less than SPY.

So, unless you needed the high volume of SPY for trading and/or options, there's really no reason, IMO, not to use one of the other three options instead to capture the lower expense ratio.

One caveat - if you are holding SPY in a taxable account and there is a decent amount of unrealized gains built into it right now, there is no reason to sell it (the expense ratio difference isn't going to make or break you long-term). Just start putting future money into one of the other three for the lower expense ratio.",10,ETFs

NativeTxn7,kxr4wi6,2024-04-02,/r/ETFs/comments/1bu3l1e/spy_or_voo_or_does_it_matter/kxr4wi6/,"Full disclosure, I personally use SPLG any time I'm wanting an S&P 500 index ETF. Long-term the returns on each should track very closely so you can use either.

The expense ratio on SPLG is 0.02% and it's 0.03% on VOO, so there is no meaningful difference there.

If you're at a brokerage that does **not** allow purchase of partial shares, then you could go with SPLG to likely be able to get more of your cash invested (though the little bit of cash you couldn't invest probably wouldn't matter too much in the long run). But if you're at a brokerage like Fidelity that allows purchase of partial shares, there should be no difference which one you use.

The key is how much you invest, not the number of shares you own.

For example, if you are at Fidelity and can just invest dollar amounts and it will buy partial shares and you invested $20,000 into VOO, you'd get about 41.935 shares at today's close and if you invested $20,000 into SPLG, you'd get about 327.708 shares. So, while you have more shares of SPLG, you still have $20,000 worth of an S&P 500 index in the end. And since they should track very closely, the returns should be the same (or very, very similar).

If you're at another brokerage with no partial shares of ETFs (e.g. Schwab), it would be approximately as follows - with VOO, you'd buy 41 shares and have $445.87 sitting in cash. With SPLG, you'd have 327 shares and have $43.19 sitting in cash. 

So, SPLG would allow you to get more of your cash invested, but as I said, that \~$400 difference probably isn't going to make much of a long-term difference.

Bottom line, is that IVV, VOO, SPLG are all effectively the same - they track the S&P 500 at a very low cost (either 0.02% or 0.03%) - and you would be fine investing in any of them.",4,ETFs

I think what most folks overlook though that there is a lot of power in the compounding of the reinvested  (currently \~ 8% dividend but has been as high as 13%) that is distributed monthly vs quarterly.  Basically giving you more and more shares and acting in a DCA like manner.  There is definitely a separation in performance as shown in the chart below. - I simply used JEPQ vs QQQ and the index itself with VOO for reference.  

I dont think JEPQ or JEPI are replacements for VOO - but I think they compliment it - more for long the long term in a non-taxable IRA so you dont potentially get hit with taxes on the dividends.

And I have a individual acc with 500$ invested in Voo. So basically I should sell the VTI , keep the Voo and invest the 200$ into something different ? Thanks",1,ETFs
Future_Man89,kxsdnsg,2024-04-03,/r/ETFs/comments/1buf5zo/voo/kxsdnsg/,You should keep the money in your Roth and focus on maxing that out and then put money in your taxable. I prefer VTI over VOO but you’d be fine with either. Of course do your own research between the two as well and make your choice.,2,ETFs

ThatPeace5,ky3j59s,2024-04-05,/r/ETFs/comments/1btw3pe/60k_into_voo_at_25_years_old_wish_me_luck/ky3j59s/,You can still invest in the Vanguard SP (VOO) while with fidelity. The only difference besides the obvious ETF vs Mutual fund is the expense ratio (0.15% difference from Fidelitys FXAIX). Which isn’t a huge deal imo.,1,ETFs
anbu-black-ops,ky4ugsl,2024-04-05,/r/ETFs/comments/1bwa9np/voo_question/ky4ugsl/,Splg is another alternative to voo if you cant buy fractional shares.  The price for one share is cheaper.,1,ETFs
DaemonTargaryen2024,ky4tvav,2024-04-05,/r/ETFs/comments/1bwa9np/voo_question/ky4tvav/,"VOO is already an index fund with a low expense ratio. 

You’re confusing ER with the share price (NAV). Doesn’t matter if VOO share price is $100 or $500, if your putting in say $1,000 you either own 10 shares or 2 shares, but you have $1000 in the fund either way",1,ETFs
