2024-03-27,Just buy VOO at this point
2024-03-27,"Voo & schg have 53% overlap. Past results don’t predict future returns but schg has consistently beat voo over the past decade. 53% of the stocks help by both etf are the same but they ain’t the same etf, not entirely. I have both in my portfolio and I personally lean heavy on schg actually in my Roth. Remember tho that investing isn’t a monolith. Good luck on your journey."
2024-03-27,"Schd + Schg makes up the majority of voo. Just buy voo, or better yet buy VTI"
2024-03-27,13% overlap with VOO and less than 1% overlap with SCHG
2024-03-28,"30% VOO, 30% QQQ, 10% VYM, 10% BND, 10% Mixed Value (e.g., Berk.b and others), 5% ACWX (or other intl ETF), 5% OUNZ (or real gold)"
2024-03-28,"Investing isn’t a monolith.

But I think you should choose one between VOO & VTI. 100% of VOO is theoretically in VTI.

Consider SCHG or VUG over VGT. VGT is a growth sector(tech) etf. SCHG or VUG are multi-sector growth etf, kinda balance risk a little and performances are similar between the 3.

In theory, something like 50% VOO/VTI and 50% SCHG/VUG. Do your research tho. These are opinions and consider QQQM as another multi-sector growth etf."
2024-03-28,"Given you age, just buy VOO"
2024-03-28,VOO
2024-03-28,"VOO & VTI are the same thing basically.  VTI just has a slight exposure to more funds.  However the etfs have an 86% overlap.  Just replace the VTI with SCHD.  If you are going to let it sit for 20+ years, I'd also up your VOO to 60%

60% VOO  
20% SCHD  
20% VGT

EDIT: You could also look into VUG, SCHG, or QQQM to replace VGT as your growth play.  However I also think Tech will continue to be strongth over the next decade."
2024-03-28,If i were you: $VOO 30% $AVUV 20% $QQQM $20% $SOXQ 20% $NVDA 5% $ISRG 5%. Enjoy beating the market.
2024-03-28,Voo is the future!!
2024-03-28,"What about both S&P 500 and NASDAQ? 

Would something like VOO + QQQ be viable?"
2024-03-28,"VGT or VUG. You’ve got time on your side and tech is the future.
You could do a VGT/VOO split 50/50 or VUG/SCHD 50/50."
2024-03-28,Pick one VOO or VTI
2024-03-28,VOO
2024-03-28,Love the SCHG play with VOO (or VTI). I recently added ICMG for a mid cap growth play too - a little tech heavier than I wanted but with a long time horizon not that worried.
2024-03-28,"In the end, they will probably track about the same. You'll be saving money in fees by sticking with voo. on the other hand you can rebalance the 2 depending on Market conditions."
2024-03-28,"QQQM is considerably more expensive than VOO too. Maybe throw a little international in there for diversity/risk mitigation like VXUS (still has 7% NAM) or VT (35% NAM) or go right out there and consider VEU. doesn’t have to be a big holding, just enough to add some diversity."
2024-03-28,"SP 500 is going to overlap with a lot of growth stocks.  For example, here are the overlaps with VOO & other popular growth ETFs  
VGT- 30%  
VUG - 56%  
SCHG - 53%  
QQQM - 46%

VGT has the least overlap of all four.  VOO is king for a reason."
2024-03-28,"There are several reasons why you want SCHD in a portfolio.

1. SCHD invests in safer & more stable stocks, so the floor is lower in bear markets.
2. Diversification is another reason. VOO & SCHD only have an 8% overlap meaning they compliment each other well.
3. Another reason is capital gains taxes. When you get ready to retire, at least for the majority of us, we aren't going to be able retire on 1.4% dividends. So you will have to sell your VOO to buy into stocks like SCHD when you do get ready to retire. Depending on how much you sell 150-300k in taxes could be likely, and thats not even taking into cosideration that the gov raises cap gains.
4. Dividend appreciation. SCHD increases its dividends every year, so if you get a base position now... in 20-30 years like you are suggesting, your APY on cost might be something like 25-30%. You'd just have to do the math on the dividend appreciation. Look at what Warren Buffett gets paid every year from just holding KO for 30 years... I personally want to be able to live off dividends so I can pass the original capital investment on to my children. SCHD gets those dividends appreciating."
2024-03-28,"I have SCHD+SCHG in my tax deferred accts ,nice about having them separate is that you can tweak the weights depending on the market…something you can’t do with VOO, so far is been great…."
2024-03-28,"To me, the only real reason to split our from a blend index (like VOO) is if you want to tilt more toward growth or value. I don't really see the point of holding a separate growth and value ETF if you're just going to split them 50/50. But if you're going to tilt one way at least 60/40 (maybe even 65/35 or more), then it can make sense to split them out."
2024-03-28,"No way to know honestly, Large growth has had a huge run over the last 3-5 years, but there is no way to know for sure if that will continue, and if it does, for how long. There is a LOT of recency bias out there right now and people are thinking that these huge tech names can't miss, but again, there is no way to know exactly what the future holds. If you go back over the historical records, value and growth have taken turns outpacing the other over various periods. Growth has been superior over the last 5-10 years.

To a certain extent, I would argue that VOO is currently a proxy for a tech fund anyway, but you get some additional diversification over a pure tech fund.

I mean, if you look at VOO, you have MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, GOOG, and AVGO making up 8 of the top 10 holdings and accounting for 29.07% of the entire S&P 500. TSLA sits at #11 and would make that total about 30.37% in just 9 out of 500 holdings.

So, it's already pretty heavily concentrated in ""tech"" - not as heavily concentrated as something like SCHG, but still plenty of exposure.

At the end of the day, if you'd tilted toward SCHG in a 60/40 or 65/35 split over the last decade or so, you'd be better off than having been in VOO (though VOO would have still done very well).

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio#analysisResults)

So, if you are confident that growth will continue to outperform, then tilting toward growth makes sense.

The hardest thing about ""tilting"" is when your tilts are not working in your favor. Let's say that you tilted 65/35 growth/value and starting tomorrow value outperformed growth for the next 5 years, would you have the discipline to stick with the tilt so that when things switch back to growth outpacing value you'll get that benefit.

There will be a lot of people telling you that you're really young and to concentrate your holdings into growth. But as I said, there's a tremendous amount of recency bias coupled with assumptions about ""tech not going anywhere"" type of thinking about things moving forward that are leading people to those conclusions.

Bottom line, you'll likely be fine with whatever path you choose as long as you stick with your plan and keep putting money in through ups and downs."
2024-03-28,"Majority of VGT is in VOO, so there’s a lot of overlap again."
2024-03-29,"VOO, VXUS, SCHD
70/10/20"
2024-03-29,"I recently started investing and bought 30 shares of VOO jn Robinhood, is it ok to use RH for my investments or is it mostly for gambling options?"
2024-03-29,Yep 100% VOO baby.
2024-03-29,VOO and FBTC.
2024-03-29,I’ve got like 25k in voo
2024-03-29,Just Schd and XLK in my Roth. Qqqm and voo in brokerage account.
2024-03-29,Just do VOO
2024-03-29,80% VOO 20% SCHD
2024-03-29," Voo, schd, vgt 20/40/40"
2024-03-29,Dca voo  every  month  for me
2024-03-29,"I recently started a Roth IRA, but I don't have VOO. I have SPLG, which is basically the same. I also have QQQM and AVUV. 60/20/20 split."
2024-03-29,"Yes. Probably lots of people on here have it as a large chunk. Started with VOO then started adding IVW instead of VOO later, but they're basically the same.

You could add Small Cap ETF like AVUV, or a Mid Cap ETF

QQQM if you think Tech sector is going to stay strong

SCHG is a good growth ETF"
2024-03-29,"According to the finance literature, growth stocks tend to underperform value stocks. On the other hand, the top holdings of VOOG are quality investments which tend to outperform the market… so investing in VOOG won’t be a terrible investment."
2024-03-29,Stick with VOO.
2024-03-29,I’ve seen VOOG and VONG popping up a lot. Any reason to go with these over VOO?
2024-03-29,"VOOV, but VOO is the mix of those two so if you can do just that it’ll be easier to manage"
2024-03-29,"The answer is diversification. VOOG excludes value, whereas VOO is a blend. And obviously QQQM is very tech heavy  (50% of the fund!) whereas VOO is about 30% tech"
2024-03-29,"VOO is a good choice. You could also do some QQQM, QQQJ, XLK or AVUV.   Some overlap a bit, so factor that in when deciding how much to invest in each."
2024-03-29,295 shares of VOO in traditional Ira and VTI in Roth
2024-03-29,I have VOOG
2024-03-29,A lot of people have done worse than just VOO.
2024-03-29,"Not gonna lie, when people say VOO and VTI are the same thing is drives me nuts. Returns are similar, but they are totally different indices. VTI literally has over 3,000 more holdings than VOO."
2024-03-29,"Monte Carlo tests say this is ideal: 

VOO
Vanguard S&P 500 ETF
25.00%
VUG
Vanguard Growth ETF
30.00%

SCHD Schwab US Dividend Equity
ETF
5.00%
VGT
Vanguard Information
Technology ETF
40.00%"
2024-03-29,"VTI is too diluted in my opinion.  I'd go with 80% VOO and 20% AVUV to get the large and small caps, then rebalance every few years.

Also, it's very important where you invest this.  I would HIGHLY suggest opening a Roth IRA and doing the max contributions for both 2023 and 2024.  The rest you can put in a brokerage account.   But in both accounts, do a 80/20 split."
2024-03-29,"I would do 40% VOO, 30% SCHD, 30% SCHG"
2024-03-29,VOO and VTI are basically the same thing (86% correlation). Just pick one.
2024-03-29,"I am not the biggest fan of vbr for scv exposure, mainly because I feel like it has a lot of exposure in mid caps as opposed to small caps. I started off with VBR, but migrated to viov, and then finally to avuv for my small cap value exposure. 

I personally wouldn't want to to tilt almost everything into tech and large cap growth. VOO/IVV/SPLG and all sp500 index funds are pretty tilted into tech and large cap growth already imo."
2024-03-29,"VTI if you want to own 'em all, VOO if you just want to own the successful ones."
2024-03-29,You’re not late. If you live to 80 you have like 47 years of growth. That’s a ton of time. 100% VOO.
2024-03-29,Far from it? VOO is 53% large cap growth. 31% tech. Why would you add a tech fund on top of that?
2024-03-29,"I started a bit late, but have been focused on adding VTI or VOO. Had VTI before, but recently switched to VOO. They track similarly, but I think I should have been adding VOO from the start."
2024-03-29,"I think what he meant is that for example you want to tilt more towards US, you can add shares of something like VOO or VTI alongside VT to increase your exposure."
2024-03-29,"Im 19 and started my journey last December, voo is the best ETF u can buy

https://preview.redd.it/r1wohqu7l6rc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a384943b048ba8c9a4f389b73106eb121292c72b"
2024-03-29,VOO is effectively a tech index.
2024-03-29,Is VOO too high to keep buying?
2024-03-29,"At your age, I would stick with VOO as your primary ETF.  I think that VOO is diversified enough (500 very large US companies) if you're prioritizing growth.  And, at your age, most people are prioritizing growth.

As you get older, there is wisdom in further diversification.

Check out r/Bogleheads!"
2024-03-29,Saying VTI wasn’t doing much and switch to VOO doesn’t make sense. VTI is something like 85% the exact same as VOO. Believe VTI just has slight bit more exposure to small caps. On any given day they will both perform almost identical.
2024-03-29,VOO/QQQM/AVUV
2024-03-30,Just got to 100 shares of VOO!
2024-03-30,"VOO is a pot of stew with 500 ingredients in it and VTI is a pot of stew with 3,700 ingredients. VTI is cheaper because they don’t give you as much stew. 😉"
2024-03-30,good points but the cost on booth schd and schg are so small 0.06% 0.04% wouldnt be much. but voo is a top running contender to any stock
2024-03-30,"Honestly, if you like the reliability of the S&P, just consider using leverage if you contribute regularly margin is fine, otherwise SSO or UPRO to whatever percentage your comfortable with in conjunction with voo and rebalance yearly. Look up the kelly criterion if you really want to get into it."

2024-03-31,"Fidelity. Start by going on your computers browser and go to fidelity.com. If you have earned income, you should start investing in an IRA, and if you exceed that, open a brokerage account. This process will take a few days whether you open an IRA or brokerage or both since fidelity will need to do an EFT (electronic funds transfer) test between your bank account and your investment account. This can take a couple days. Once that's settled and you send money over, go to the search bar in the fidelity website and type in VOO, then click the big green buy button. Under the buy conditions just select ""market order"", select ""dollars"" and just enter the amount of cash in your account. It will then buy as many shares as possible at the current bid/ask spread with the amount of dollars you offered up. Fidelity does fractional shares, so you will be able to get partial cost bases to utilize a maximal amount of your cash.



The fidelity brokerage account can also be used as a form of rainy day savings account, since you can set your default cash position to SPAXX which is a money market fund getting around 5% per year these days."
2024-03-31,"Just wanted to make sure you knew that once you pick your broker (I use vanguard), you’ll deposit money into your account (it is called your settlement account or money market fund, but think of it as a normal bank account), but then you have to use that money in your deposited account  to actually BUY VOO.

Sounds obvious - but I have heard of beginners to investing thinking they were investing in something, but not realizing their money was just sitting in a settlement (cash) account 😅"
2024-03-31,"Type in SPLG on your brokerage and enjoy the lower expense ratio and lower price per share, while also holding the same index as VOO."
2024-03-31,Invest in VOO simple on almost all exchanges even Cash App its available
2024-03-31,"Go to Interactive brokers, open account, fund it and just buy VOO."
2024-03-31,VOO all the way and forget it.
2024-03-31,"1. Why VOO over spy or ivv? Just curious why redditors like VOO over other sp500 indexes.

2. I have a bunch of XLK (tech) and SCHD (dividends)… what next?"
2024-03-31,"I wouldn't worry about the overlap too much.  VOO is my pick, but all three are conservative wins for long term investors.  You could look at a REIT like O as well."
2024-03-31,"I have VOO and VTI in my portfolio.  Fund overlap with slight differences in distribution can be used as a tool in portfolio creation.  VTI would also give you some exposure to small and mid while still heavily weighted in the S&P.  VT with its almost 10000 holdings would be the next evolution in that thought process; still heavy in S&P while slightly increasing exposure to mid, small, and international.  That said I am of the opinion over time the S&P will outperform.  If you do sell Id suggest SPY; its greatest strength is its liquidity and if you’re long that’s less of a benefit.  Subsequently the spread would be better on the sale and VOO has a better expense ratio.  That said I wouldn’t be in a rush to sell.  If you find yourself ahead of the tax man then the sale could be an opportunity for tax loss harvesting.  Say in the future you sell something for a profit and at some point in that same year the S&P is down.  You’d sell SPY (at a loss) take the proceeds and by VOO.  Your taxes on what you sold for profit would be offset by the “loss” you took on SPY.  In reality you didn’t really take a loss because you sold your position in the S&P and went right back in to the S&P.  While tax wash rules wouldn’t apply because these are technically completely different funds."
2024-03-31,You can always tax loss harvest between voo and vti. Not considered a wash sale when doing so.
2024-03-31,"SPY is great for selling covered calls and buying 0DTE options. Keep VTI and VOO. Add QQQ, BITO, VYM, SCHD."
2024-03-31,"I posted this in another conversation:

I would spread your risk more. International (IEFA), large growth (which you have with SCHG, I use VUG), technology (XLK, SMH), home construction (ITB), S & P 500 (VOO, you have this). I found the only reliable stocks for growth are Visa and Mastercard as cash is used increasingly less. I agree with the other poster to stay away from small caps. For pure growth as you have a long time line, I would say my portfolio is superior.....try to put your 3 funds against my 8 funds on portfoliovisualizer.com. You get better returns and more dividends.

Love to hear some feedback!

2024-03-31,Why all the downvotes for voo?
2024-03-31,VOO.
2024-03-31,"Apologies for my being pedantic, but VOO is %0.13 according to Yahoo Finance, and IVV is %0.03."
2024-03-31,"VOO/VTI/SPY all general fine performers. Total market/world.

Tech is still #1, I suggest 50% more tech, XLK/SMH/FNGS."
2024-03-31,Don't buy SPY. Buy SPLG. It has a lower expense ratio than VOO and far lower than SPY and they all track the same index.
2024-03-31,Sell VOO and SPY and move to VTI. This is the way. 🫡
2024-03-31,"At today's levels, direct new money to VB.  Still has a nice lift left over the next few years. VTI/VOO are likely to go sideways from today's levels."
2024-03-31,IVV and VOO are both 0.03%
2024-04-01,"I've read some threads disapproving of it, but VOO/ IYW seems to be working pretty well for me."
2024-04-01,"It has a 0.89% expense ratio. VOO has an expense ratio of 0.03%. It's a mid cap blend, which is a particularly strange thing to go all in on imho.

Anyway, thank you for patriotic love of taxes! You're helping fund our schools and roads and parks!"
2024-04-01,Yea my comment was more if you guys were looking to buy a house in two years from now. If you guys are looking to move relatively soon the. It wouldn’t make much sense to park your money for a while. But here’s to VOO retiring us both! 🍾
2024-04-01,I already have an ETF in my Roth IRA. VOO is going in my brokerage in case I decide I want to retire early from the gainz and then live off VOO for like 10-20 years until I am able to withdrawal from my Roth IRA
2024-04-01,What do you mean by learning? What's there to learn about making deposits into that VOO periodically? I want to learn more as well hence asking.
2024-04-01,What is VOO?
2024-04-01,How much are going investing monthly into VOO?
2024-04-01,Is the plan to add another two or three ETFs to balance VOO out somewhere down the road?
2024-04-01,"Fair and no thanks. As a wiseman once said, VOO and chill"
2024-04-01,All you need is voo
2024-04-01,"not at all. like someone  posted in another thread.  someone's uncle retired with only SPY after 25 yrs. You can't go wrong with VTI, VOO, or SPY."
2024-04-01,VOO rocks!
2024-04-01,I'm doing straight VOO in my IRA as well. Use a target date fund for my 401k. So I feel pretty diversified as far as retirement investments go.
2024-04-01,"REIT has been a tough segment. At this level of investment, I'd just pour it all into VOO honestly."
2024-04-01,"80% VOO 10% VXUS 10% REIT is an okay portfolio. I personally do not overweight REIT’s since REIT returns are well explained by the value size term and credit factors, so I can get comparable returns through a combination of small cap value stocks and high yield bonds without the risks idiosyncratic to the real estate sector. Because of this it doesn’t really make sense to overweight REIT’s in excess of their market cap weights"
2024-04-01,VOO is better than 99% of portfolios out there
2024-04-02,"Good move, I’ve got everything in VOO"
2024-04-02,"Maybe you should have waited till at least this morning 😜  Or dollar cost averaged your entry.

Anyway... I probably wouldn't go all in on VOO right now, with a P/E over 25. I'd probably do 50% VOO, with the remaining divided up between small-cap value, large-cap developed markets international, and T-Bills. Maybe dividend-focused value as well.

But good luck in any case!"
2024-04-02,"Why not just leave VTI as is and buy VOO from now onwards. 99% of VOO holding are in VTI, so you will just be more concentrated in the VOO holding going forward."
2024-04-02,I would just start adding to VOO and from what I have gathered any realized gains in your Roth are still tax free.
2024-04-02,wait is VOO and s&p 500 the same thing?
2024-04-02,"Keep buying and never sell. Remember even during recessions, you still earn dividends on VOO."
2024-04-02,"Wild. VOO was the first ETF I came across when reviewing VFIAX, and I came to r/ETFs to see what other ETFs redditors own, and learn more about ETF investing. Happy to see I'm down the right rabbit hole."
2024-04-02,"Not taxable since it's in a Roth IRA, both of them are extremely similar but I prefer VOO over VTI. If you want even lower expense ratio then I would go with FXAIX at .015% compared to VOO at 0.03%."
2024-04-02,Yep I’m about to switch my ROTH to basically all VOO
2024-04-02,"Question for ya

Why VOO over VTI?

I have 30k I need to put somewhere"
2024-04-02,"If you really want to avoid trading friction, just add VOO, but idk why someone would pick it over VTI."
2024-04-02,Why bother selling VTI and VOO? They both have almost identical returns over the long term and VTI has extra diversification. Seems like all you're doing is paying bid/ask spread fees.
2024-04-02,Lmao. This isn't how you invest. You don't YOLO into the VOO. you build a position slowly on dips. You're going to be pissed when the market corrects and you have little buying power
2024-04-02,Same - I started pumping $ into VOO January 2020.  Took some courage to put more in after the drop in March/April 2020.
2024-04-02,"VOO is the s&p index with the lowest fees, which is why everyone is using and recommending it. 

The reason S&P is safe is because the only way the stock can really go down, is if the us economy collapses, in which case you would have lost your money in any investment. However, if the us economy survives, the s&p will again be profitable. 

Basically, you buy and hold and let compound interest make you a millionaire. Pretty much the only thing that can prevent it is nuclear war, and if you think nuclear war is likely you have other things to worry about than investments."
2024-04-02,Got $45k in VOO at 21. I’m right there with you boss 🫡
2024-04-02,Voo and luck? VOO is exactly designed for your profile.No need to worry:)
2024-04-02,"I’m new to this, what decisions go into picking VOO versus VTI and or VXUS, etc. ??"
2024-04-02,VOO is like a giant Redwood tree… Just set the seed and watch it grow
2024-04-02,Dividends are un-necessary at your age. I’d put that percentage into VOO
2024-04-02,"Dividend focus is never relevant in any portfolio. Just focus on broad diversification and whether or not you want exposure to risk premia. This means more or less equity allocation for exposure to stocks vs risk free assets as well as whether you want to over weight to value risks, Small CPAs, profitability, or reinvestment factors. SCHD is more valuey than a blend like VOO. VGT is just silly at these valuations, just don't bro. 

Also, you're 100% US which isn't a super great idea. Maybe add VEA or VXUS if you want emerging markets."
2024-04-02,"At your age, I'd go as aggressive as I could, maybe 50/50 VOO/VGT.   Factor in dividends as you get older."
2024-04-02,Would 80/20 VOO and VXUS be better?
2024-04-02,Hello what if I put 100k into voo do you think that will be smart ? I’m 28 I’m looking for passive income but I’m new to investing trying to figure out what’s best for me
2024-04-02,"SPY has much higher volume, so use it if you are trading it or using options with it. If you're just buying and holding for the long-run, go with VOO, IVV, or SPLG.

All 4 of these track the S&P 500, but VOO, IVV, and SPLG all cost less than SPY.

So, unless you needed the high volume of SPY for trading and/or options, there's really no reason, IMO, not to use one of the other three options instead to capture the lower expense ratio.

One caveat - if you are holding SPY in a taxable account and there is a decent amount of unrealized gains built into it right now, there is no reason to sell it (the expense ratio difference isn't going to make or break you long-term). Just start putting future money into one of the other three for the lower expense ratio."
2024-04-02,"SPY is better for trading due to its daily options. 

VOO is better for longterm holding due to its lower ER. "
2024-04-02,Voo is your way
2024-04-02,"Appreciate the thorough breakdown. That’s what I was thinking of doing as well - don’t sell anything right now, but move all future buys into VOO rather than SPY."
2024-04-02,Why not go SPLG over VOO? Or do these matter in the same ways described. Just seems like the ER and price per share is better.
2024-04-02,"Full disclosure, I personally use SPLG any time I'm wanting an S&P 500 index ETF. Long-term the returns on each should track very closely so you can use either.

The expense ratio on SPLG is 0.02% and it's 0.03% on VOO, so there is no meaningful difference there.

If you're at a brokerage that does **not** allow purchase of partial shares, then you could go with SPLG to likely be able to get more of your cash invested (though the little bit of cash you couldn't invest probably wouldn't matter too much in the long run). But if you're at a brokerage like Fidelity that allows purchase of partial shares, there should be no difference which one you use.

The key is how much you invest, not the number of shares you own.

For example, if you are at Fidelity and can just invest dollar amounts and it will buy partial shares and you invested $20,000 into VOO, you'd get about 41.935 shares at today's close and if you invested $20,000 into SPLG, you'd get about 327.708 shares. So, while you have more shares of SPLG, you still have $20,000 worth of an S&P 500 index in the end. And since they should track very closely, the returns should be the same (or very, very similar).

If you're at another brokerage with no partial shares of ETFs (e.g. Schwab), it would be approximately as follows - with VOO, you'd buy 41 shares and have $445.87 sitting in cash. With SPLG, you'd have 327 shares and have $43.19 sitting in cash. 

So, SPLG would allow you to get more of your cash invested, but as I said, that \~$400 difference probably isn't going to make much of a long-term difference.

Bottom line, is that IVV, VOO, SPLG are all effectively the same - they track the S&P 500 at a very low cost (either 0.02% or 0.03%) - and you would be fine investing in any of them."
2024-04-02,"Sorry guys, I've been buying VOO since I started work in summer 2022, market knew I didn't deserve long term gains"
2024-04-02,I brought VOO during 2021 peak... 2022 was hard to bear but it's all okay now
2024-04-02,I bought voo at 482 and I regret it.   When it was at 454. I was trying to time the market and it kept going up and slightly coming down. I got tired and just bought at 482.     It hasn’t been back to 482 in 2 weeks about
2024-04-02,"I'll echo others, just leave your VTI holdings alone and begin buying VOO.  Out of the two I'd go VOO anyway as the miniscule holdings in VTI that make it ""total market"" are very insignificant and don't do much positive or negative to it."
2024-04-02,Why the preference for VOO over VTI.
2024-04-02,Don’t worry you’re not the only boomer on here who thinks ‘market go up’ I wouldn’t touch VOO with a 10ft pole at these levels
2024-04-02,I really try to set 2k aside every month. I buy on days when it gets in the -1% range (I bought 1VOO earlier today). Figure this is the most logical way to time the market since there’s usually some of those every month.
2024-04-02,You don’t need luck. You have VOO
2024-04-02,"Excellent. Leave it for at least 30 years. One way door, more goes into that, and nothing comes out or changes to something else. 
If you want something else, use $ to buy in. Don’t sell VOO to rebalance. 

This tree is going to grow and bear sweet fruit later in life."
2024-04-02,"Nice! My Roth is 100% VOO I’m 31, let’s see where we are in 30 years haha"
2024-04-02,"Vti follows voo very similar , Vxus is ex-us for more international diversity."
2024-04-02,Yes. VOO is index fund that track the sp500.
2024-04-02,I have my Roth vti and vxus but voo itself is more then amazing
2024-04-02,"When working with clients in the industry I am in I receive 80% of my sales focusing on 20% of my book - it’s called the 80/20 rule

Took that same approach with VOO - I am going to invest in the top 500 companies for long term growth instead of a larger pool of small market cap companies with VTI

My top clients never failed me and if the top 500 company’s plummet then there are bigger issues at stake

I also purchased at 480 so if the price drops to 380 that’s a 21% loss. That 21% loss for me will be 12k. I can live with that because I make up for it with 5 paychecks 

Plus who cares if I lose 12k in a year, I’ll just buy more shares

We will see where I am at in 10 years"
2024-04-02,"I think this thread is what I needed to move my 401k from a target date fund to s&p 500 mutual fund. My roth ira is already about 70% voo 30% ftec and I figured I'd keep the 401k more conservative, but the underperformance is frustrating"
2024-04-02,"If you're investing long term, you can't go wrong with VOO"
2024-04-02,Vti and voo is simple. No need to complicate it. JL Collins explains it.
2024-04-02,"This is what, like, 3k? 2.5k

Theres very little reason to overanalyze your holdings at this level of investment. If you spent 10 hours researching and rebalancing and whatever, and beat the market by 1% (which is like, insanely good and very unrealistic,) you would only have netted like 3$ for that 10 hours of work.

Just voo+vxus and chill dude. No reason to worry about your portfolio beyond that unless you have a significant amount where 0-1% is actually a sun of money that matters."
2024-04-02,What is a good VOO type stock for small cap
2024-04-02,VOO is already diversified.
2024-04-02,"I tried doing a shit ton of research when I started investing, now 90% of my money is in VOO lmao"
2024-04-02,Would like to see what you’re pushing if not VOO. I’m on IVV instead of VOO. I’m new tho.
2024-04-02,"This is total US so more like VTI not VOO but VTI is like 80%+ S&P500 already so it's close. The second chart in this article is a good visual of US vs. International performance.

[https://avidianwealth.com/financial-insights/articles/international-stock-outperformance/](https://avidianwealth.com/financial-insights/articles/international-stock-outperformance/)  


These are rolling 5 year returns not annual; if you looked at annual there were certainly times when international outperformed domestic in the past 15 years."
2024-04-02,"Prob things incredibly similar to VOO, like VUG"
2024-04-02,"My portfolio, with no VOO

https://preview.redd.it/rep2ic2f9zrc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6944860e5bfdd165c40aa69ed03e81faa7070228"
2024-04-02,"The 1% is anything that is more diversified than the 500 largest stocks from a single nation who also have comparatively higher valuations (lower expected returns).

VT or VTI + VXUS is *objectively* more sensible and also has higher expected returns than VOO and past performance means absolutely nothing in arguing against that, by the way.

All that being said though, VOO is fine. And yes better than probably the majority of investors portfolios."
2024-04-02,When was the last time VXUS outperformed VOO?
2024-04-02,"No, voo is s&p 500 
Vti is meant to be the whole US Market"
2024-04-02,"VOO: Fortune 500

VTI: total US

VXUS: international"
2024-04-02,"Looks like a bad move, mate. Do you move back when VXUS outperforms VOO for a couple of years in a row? This is a classic buy low sell high as if I've ever seen. What is your reasoning for going VOO? Besides the 1 year rate of return? Since you didn't explain I assume that was the extent of your analysis

Those fund managers Vanguard have 10 year forecasts for US equity vs International equity and I think US was around 4% and Intl was like 7% annualized.

Regardless, since we are emotional beings, and emotions are detrimental to long term returns, you have to have very high level of conviction to stick with one strategy for the long term. Some people decide that market cap weighted passive investing is the best way to take the emotion out of investing. This would be close to 60/40 VTI/VXUS. Others look for factors to maximize risk adjusted rate of return. Others prefer active managers while still being sufficiently diversified across company size, location, sector, and quality. These are sensible options to me since you have concrete rules to how the portfolios are constructed. Going with arbitrary weightings like 80/10/10 is likely going to make you change your mind when one of the positions is under performing for several years, especially since s&p500 is all large cap domestic equities, heavily concentrated in the technological sector. This  sector is known to go through very long and bad cycles for investment returns."
2024-04-02,Can I get this through fidelity? I have an extra 40-50k I was going to move into my money market but maybe I should get a little bit of VOO instead? Sorry I’m a super noob grew up poor so this is all very new to me.
2024-04-02,Don’t you have to buy all of VOO which is like 470$? Or do you just keep adding money until you buy the fund?
2024-04-02,You can’t go wrong with VOO long term.
2024-04-02,"That's a perfectly fine ratio, don't let people talk you out of schd... it's one of best etfs to pair with VOO. Very little overlap. SCHD invests in safer companies so your floor will be lower in bad years. Plus SCHD grows it's dividend every year.  When you get ready to retire, your dividend to cost might look something like 15-20%. Look at the dividends Warren buffet gets from just holding an initial investment of KO."
2024-04-02,VTI and VOO usually go gradual. Long term investments.
2024-04-02,"I was a little abrasive, sure. There's no need to zoom call. I'll give you free alpha right here. 

The rate environment right now is favorable to cash. You can hold your cash in a brokerage account that pays 5% APY. You don't have to Yolo it all into VOO which (If it stays flat) will actually produce less income than the cash. 

Market doesn't just go up indefinitely.  Its in need of a correction now. On red days, buy small portions of ETFs or stocks that you like. Add them up over time."
2024-04-02,"Yes, you can buy VOO within a Fidelity account."
2024-04-02,I’m going to be honest. You’re kind of saying a whole lot of nothing to me. If I buy VOO today will it be a lot less in 10 years?
2024-04-02,"I’m on a 82k yearly salary, living with my parents, ~$8k in yearly expenses and I just put 60k into VOO for long term gains. 

Thanks for your insight but I am not trying to get rich overnight"
2024-04-02,"Good points. The difference is, is that this market is even more  overextended than this time last year. We don't break new ATHs every week for eternity. It just doesn't work like that. 

With the whole ""time in the market"" debate, with interest rates on univested cash the way they are right now and with stock market with a very high chance of correction over the next year; I'm saying that the 5% return is a much safer bet than VOO at these levels over the next year. 

That being said, a slow DCA over said year (on red days)would no doubt provide a greater rate of return and new investor confidence"
2024-04-02,We are very happy with our VOO returns ❤️
2024-04-02,"Someone give me a quick breakdown between VTI, VOO, and VXUS. thanks ☺️"
2024-04-02,Is Voo any Vti the same thing?
2024-04-02,VOO VOO VOO
2024-04-02,"Im kinda new to this, what is VOO?"
2024-04-02,VOO and chill
2024-04-02,"EXACTLY!  My dude doesn't even understand what kind of account he has and he's over thinking VTI vs VOO, like he's going to miss out on some kind of windfall if he doesn't switch.

I believe this ""don't duplicate"" narrative is getting to people. It's absolutely harmless to own both VTI and VOO, and their returns are not enough different to even give it a second thought."
2024-04-03,Voo time !sit back and relax.Always VOO let it makes you rich overtime! No brainer!
2024-04-03,VOO for life
2024-04-03,"Like others said, VTI is basically VOO with a very small percentage of mid/small caps making up the difference. In fact, by market cap they overlap by 86%.  If you want, start a new position in VOO and keep what you have in VTI."
2024-04-03,What pairs well with VOO/SCHD
2024-04-03,"It's not a bad idea, but it wouldn’t add anything *new*. Others have mentioned that 80% of VTI would directly overlap with VOO, but also VOO is about 40% of VFIFX (because VTI is 55% of VFIFX). 

SCHD and VYM are each about 70% US large cap, though being dividend-focused they would have different sector weights than the S&P (namely they wouldn’t be as Mag7-heavy.)"
2024-04-03,VOO and VTI are nearly identical. They track the S&P 500 index. They have 99% overlap. I would stick with one or the other.
2024-04-03,You should keep the money in your Roth and focus on maxing that out and then put money in your taxable. I prefer VTI over VOO but you’d be fine with either. Of course do your own research between the two as well and make your choice.
2024-04-03,"Hey I’m new to investing I have a quick question . I have a Roth IRA Invested 200$ in vti. And I have a individual acc with 500$ invested in Voo. So basically I should sell the VTI , keep the Voo and invest the 200$ into something different ? Thanks"
2024-04-03,Can I buy VOO now ? or what for a certain drop. I would be a first time buyer.
2024-04-03,$VOO is for homeless people
2024-04-03,I have $100K in VOO. Godspeed
2024-04-03,"About to make a similar move myself. Curious what made you choose the VOO ETF over the VFIAX mutual fund. I know the expense ratio is slightly higher on the MF, but it would allow recurring investments. Personally planning on an intial lump sum followed by paycheck % moving forward."
2024-04-03,"Good luck with a portfolio of ""ONE"" investment.  Yea, I know, it has a lot of them and already diversified.  Tell that the clients of Bear Sterns or a few other investment firms that went down.  Sure, Vanguard is a good firm.  But all your eggs in ONE basket?  Not for me.  3 to 5 would be a good number.  In addition to VOO, you could consider something ""a little different"" such as precious metals ETF, such as RING, and maybe a BITCOIN ETF, such as IBIT.  If you absolutely hate bonds, and chose to use a zero bond portfolio, well at least you have some company, as I have almost no bonds in my portfolio currently, tho I may consider adding some.   Bonds tend to run counter cyclical to stocks, so, if you needed money, and stocks were down, you could sell some bonds and not have to take losses on stocks.  PDI is a bond fund which is pretty consistent at paying about a 12 percent plus dividend, so its a little hard not to keeps some in your portfolio, with them over 13 percent, now."
2024-04-03,Anyone knows the equivalent to VOO in the European market?
2024-04-03,No. You already have VOO within VTI and the target retirement date fund.
2024-04-03,"Thanks for being very specific unlike other people on here. VOO for long term - I had to pull the trigger if not I’ll never do it seeking the perfect “diverse portfolio”

I’m new, I’ll learn and try to layer in 2 other investments down the line"
2024-04-03,"So it’s an investment strategy to have holdings in two different ETFs that index the market in a similar fashion (in this example - VTI/VOO). In times of economic stress/market downturns, there becomes a tax advantage by selling one of the ETFs at a loss (to deduct the loss on your taxes) and immediately buying into the subsequent ETF during the market low. This allows the ETF you bought into to possibly grow into a larger capital gain since you bought into during market low and ultimately lowering your average cost per share. This isn’t considered a wash sale since the two ETFs do not have the exact same holdings."
2024-04-03,"Some info [here](https://www.etf.com/sections/etf-basics/vanguard-funds-voo-vs-vfiax#:~:text=The%20main%20differences%20between%20VOO,end%20of%20the%20trading%20day) but both track the S&P 500 and if you compare on Vanguard you'll see the performance numbers are virtually the same. To paraphrase that article, my understanding is that VOO as an ETF can be traded intraday like a stock, so investors might enter a position at different price points. VFIAX as a mutual fund only trades once per day after the markets close. VFIAX expense ratio is 0.04% vs VOO 0.03%. I'm happy with that if it means I can set recurring investments into the fund. Other than that, if you're holding long term, no major differences as far as I can tell - but quite new to this and very happy to be enlightened if anyone else has insight."
2024-04-03,So I finally did it.. I dumped 90% into VOO and 10% into BND. 😅
2024-04-03,$VOO is for people who hate money
2024-04-03,"I agree with you u/philman792 .  I think what most folks overlook though that there is a lot of power in the compounding of the reinvested  (currently \~ 8% dividend but has been as high as 13%) that is distributed monthly vs quarterly.  Basically giving you more and more shares and acting in a DCA like manner.  There is definitely a separation in performance as shown in the chart below. - I simply used JEPQ vs QQQ and the index itself with VOO for reference.  

I dont think JEPQ or JEPI are replacements for VOO - but I think they compliment it - more for long the long term in a non-taxable IRA so you dont potentially get hit with taxes on the dividends.

Personally - I have 4 primary ETFs that make up a good chunk of my portfolio.  VTI (20%), SPY (10 %), JEPQ (7.5%), JEPI (5%).

2024-04-03,"Have held VTI for quite a while and though VOO usually track's nearly the same as VTI. Voo is performing better as of late. A little diversity in ones portfolio isn't necessarily needed but it's not a bad plan either  . Could get a small stake in XLU for the added div's. That's a nice get and hold ETF. Even SMH :though significantly higher expense ratio and a bit riskier, it has consistently performed fairly well."
2024-04-03,DVOO > VOO
2024-04-03,"No. VOO and VTI are nearly identical. Either are good, but not both.

Other ETFs I like are VXF, VONG, and VGT. Also watching VGE."
2024-04-04,"Some platforms like M1 Finance or Fidelity Go let you create baskets like this to set percentages, which automatically distributs. Most however, you have to calculate on your own (i.e. if you add $100, $60 goes to VOO, $30 goes to VIG, etc)"
2024-04-04,Same all in 2 days ago in VUG and VOO
2024-04-04,What’s the reasoning for one going all in with VOO versus VTI and or VTI/VXUS?
2024-04-04,Voo is great because you can do fractional buys.
2024-04-05,You can still invest in the Vanguard SP (VOO) while with fidelity. The only difference besides the obvious ETF vs Mutual fund is the expense ratio (0.15% difference from Fidelitys FXAIX). Which isn’t a huge deal imo.
2024-04-05,">VOO: Fortune 500

S&P 500, not Fortune 500. They're not the same thing."
2024-04-05,Splg is another alternative to voo if you cant buy fractional shares.  The price for one share is cheaper.
2024-04-05,"VOO is already an index fund with a low expense ratio. 

You’re confusing ER with the share price (NAV). Doesn’t matter if VOO share price is $100 or $500, if your putting in say $1,000 you either own 10 shares or 2 shares, but you have $1000 in the fund either way"
