VXUS has been mostly flat for the last 10 years. The way it’s been described to me is you want to load up on international when it’s on discount because there will be years where it goes way up and the US market is down. It’s a hedge in a way between the 2. The safest investment would be investing in the whole world in something like VT. I prefer more US exposure as it’s 60% US and 40% international. But in all honesty, VOO, VTI, or VT would all be acceptable for a 1 fund. VOO is the least diverse, but also has the highest returns over the last decade. Mixing in VXUS is probably the wisest thing to do. In any case, starting at 21, you will have a lot of zeros in your account when you’re older. Maxing out retirement accounts in your 20’s is probably the best financial decision you could ever make.

ETA: It may not matter to you but Warren Buffet has said his wife will be invested in VOO 100% when he dies and recommends that to most investors.",5,ETFs

You're excluding some asset classes that typically outperform large cap (small and mid caps) and expose yourself to single-country risk by avoiding international diversification.

The benefit of selling VOO to purchase VTI (or vice versa) is that both of these ETFs follow nearly the same trajectory *very* closely. Just have to look at their performance history over any time period. 

So, the strategy is to sell one of them for a loss then purchase the other. Both will then regain value at nearly the same rate, (pending nuclear Armageddon) based on their performance history. Then, during the next down cycle sell VTI and purchase VOO (or vice versa). 

Blows my mind the more I think about this. One could literally accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars in realized capital loss over the next decade or two. This way, when you are actually in retirement, and need to sell some shares, you could do so without paying any capital gains tax since you would be able to just subtract those gains from your stockpile of capital loss.

In terms of ETF spread, the safest broadest option is VT, followed by a split of VTI and VXUS, VOO is slightly more aggressive than either of these approaches, and QQQM a step more aggressive. At your age VOO is perfectly reasonable. I'm 25 and my strategy is 40% QQQM 40% VTI and 20% VXUS to favor my exposure towards large cap tech stocks.

remember this: millions and millions of americans are already doing some sort of DCA (dollar cost averaging) whether they want to or not. they are forced to buy whether it's at an all time high or all time low. it's called their 401k. the worst thing they can do is turn off 401k contributions. if you are afraid of it being at an all time high, then just do the same strategy and perform DCA, just like with your 401k, but in your roth or regular brokerage account and you'll likely be fine in the end.

nostratic,kvo5mkz,2024-03-20 09:29:41,/r/ETFs/comments/1biurw6/similar_stock_to_voo/kvo5mkz/,">For all stages of the life cycle, owning market cap weight index funds is statistically superior to focusing on dividend payments.

sorry, that's complete nonsense and unsupported by the data. 

a) Dividend paying stocks outperform, long-term. 

>Dividend investing has historically outperformed both the broader market and value investing, and at the same time shown lower risk. Dividend investing ‘overlap’ with both value investing and low-volatility investing, but is an independent investment style of its own. The specific reasons for the outperformance of dividend investing are a reduction in the agency costs associated with high free cash flows and a probable systematic mispricing (undervaluation) of high dividend paying stocks. Dividend investing sees fewer years with losses, which according to prospect theory adds significant utility to investor experience. The outperformance of high dividend yield stocks has been robust over the 1928-2011 timeframe. Since the underlying reasons for this outperformance are more behavioral in nature than institutional, chances are that history will repeat itself.

b) Market cap weighting is literally the worst way to invest. Weight stocks literally any other way, LITERALLY, and it will beat market cap weighting. Weight by dividends, book value, earning, revenue, even randomly and it will give better long-term results than market-cap weighting.

You can do something in between if you are anxious about investing it all at once. The Money Guy has a rule that you can follow:

1. If the sum you are investing is less than 10% of your net worth, invest it all at once.

2. If not, invest what would constitute that 10% at once, and add one month (up to a year) for each additional 5%.

""Tax-loss harvesting involves selling a position with losses in order to [reduce your taxes](https://www.mezzi.com/blog/save-on-your-taxes), either by offsetting capital gains or maximizing your ordinary income tax deduction. In order to receive the tax benefit, the IRS does not allow investors to repurchase the same stock, ETF, or mutual fund for 31 days. However, they can buy similar securities.

In fact, many professional wealth advisors and robo advisors like Wealthfront and Betterment employ this strategy of repurchasing similar securities to boost returns. Data shows that effective tax-loss harvesting can increase returns[ by approximately 1%](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3351382#:~:text=yields%20a%20tax%20alpha%20of%201.10%25%20per%20year%20from%201926%20to%202018.). Over several years, that 1% compounds to much more.""

A) 50% chance for -20% return, and 50% chance for +40% return

B) 50% chance for -10% return, and 50% chance for +15% return

On average, in terms of return A outperforms B, but in terms of variance A underperforms B. For people who prefer A, they should do lump sum; and for people who prefer B, they should do DCA. Both are logical decisions, they serve different purposes and prioritization.

Regarding your rationale of "" why not just invest a lump sum in a less risky, portfolio, than dollar cost averaging in a more risky portfolio "".

Despite my best efforts in previous exchanges, you also somehow continue to miss the simple fact that for many, it's a ***risk*** consideration, not just an exercise in chasing returns. I.e. **not** buying 1 single country out of nearly 200 in the world. See Bernstein on ""deep risks."" The US is not somehow immune to catastrophic black swans. I sleep much easier at night knowing my global portfolio is insulated against idiosyncratic single country risk. Period.

Investing for retirement is about aiming for a high probability of a good outcome, not a low probability of a great outcome. Global diversification is inarguably more fitting for the former.

I'll briefly touch on a few of your points just for posterity for novices lurking, as you refused to engage in good faith in previous threads and you seem to just love trolling.

No, US large caps do not provide meaningful international diversification. Stop suggesting that they do. Stocks tend to move with their country of domicile. u/Fun_Grapefruit_3416 and u/givemeyourbiscuitplz touched on this elsewhere in this thread. We care about how ***stock markets*** behave relative to each other. By that logic, foreign companies do a ton of business with the US, so I guess we don't need US stocks...

Similarly, stop using the strawman comparison of US vs. ex-US. No one is seriously suggesting 100% ex-US as a portfolio. The realistic comparison is US vs. *global*. The latter has delivered greater general and risk-adjusted returns over most extended rolling periods historically, which basically refutes your entire argument.

Past performance does not indicate future performance, especially not the recent past. Stop suggesting that it does. Massive US dominance [is a very recent phenomenon](https://mebfaber.com/2019/07/08/i-dont-feel-overweight/) that we wouldn't expect to continue.

Imagine for a second that we knew nothing of the past behavior of markets relative to each other. How should we invest today? Probably not 1 single country.

Economic growth and stock returns are, at best, unrelated, and [have actually been negatively correlated historically](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6622.2012.00385.x). Stop equating them.

The unique ""risks"" you mention of ex-US markets are *precisely* what provide the imperfect correlation and diversification benefit; this is particularly true of Emerging Markets. Stop making it sound like any ""risk"" is inherently bad.

Please stop making patently false statements like ""ex-US stocks have underperformed for decades."" One need only glance at the Lost Decade 2000-2009 to see this isn't true.

Stop suggesting avg. pairwise correlations of markets capture the nuances of diversification, and that ""globalization"" obviates the need for it.

A lot of these points aren't new and have been refuted *ad nauseam*. To me they just reek of recency bias, familiarity bias, narrative bias, outcome bias, authority bias, and recency bias. By definition, these biases do not provide a substantive basis for an argument. Stop using them to suggest a particular investing strategy for the future.

People said a lot of the same things about the Japanese market when it was the largest in the world in the late 80's leading up to its meteoric crash.

For anyone curious, I'd also highly suggest checking out u/Cruian's famous list of resources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15bvmpl/comment/jttdehm/), on which I'm lucky enough to be included, from a related salient discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/comments/15bvmpl/i_dont_understand_the_love_for_vt/).",5,ETFs

The argument presents a comprehensive case for favoring a 100% US investment portfolio over international investments, citing numerous advantages that the US holds. Key points include:

- **Structural Benefits**: The US is highlighted for its technological leadership, business-friendly environment, individualistic culture conducive to entrepreneurship, strategic geography, and ability to integrate immigrants effectively, all contributing to its investment appeal.


- **Historical Performance**: A Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.17% since 1926 is presented as evidence of the sufficiency of US investments alone.


- **Government Support and Global Reach**: The US government's readiness to bolster the economy and the global operation of US companies underpin the argument that the S&P 500 serves as a global index but benefits from US regulatory governance.


- **Concerns about International Markets**: Issues such as different priorities in maximizing shareholder returns and additional risks (currency, sovereign) associated with international investing are highlighted.

- **Earnings Growth and Valuation**: Strong earnings growth in US companies and concerns about the attractiveness of exUS equities when adjusted for sector weight are discussed. The potential of US small caps as an alternative to high large cap valuations is also mentioned.


- **Long-term Underperformance of International Stocks**: Data is presented to show the historical underperformance of international stocks compared to US stocks and bonds.


- **Tax Efficiency and Cost**: US stocks are portrayed as more tax-efficient and lower in cost compared to foreign stocks.


- **Dwindling Diversification Benefits**: The argument suggests that globalization has reduced the diversification benefits of international stocks.


- **US Advantages**: Several US advantages are listed, including productive labor force, quality corporate management, extensive R&D spending, favorable demographics, top universities, energy resources, the scale of the domestic market, and the global dominance of the US dollar.


- **Resilience and Earnings Generation**: The resilience of the US, respect for property rights, safe-haven status, and enduring factors contributing to earnings generation power are emphasized.

The stance is supported by quotes from prominent investors like John Bogle and Warren Buffet, advocating for a US-centric investment strategy. Buffet's reflections on the enduring ""American Tailwind"" underscore confidence in the long-term bet on America despite its challenges.",2,ETFs

They're also pretty good at ignoring data showing how the US market regularly underperforms international (like this post claiming US has outperformed for decades).See image. The US is not immune to risks specific to a single country. It's not even the best stock market in the world historically. The economy is not the stock market [https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2023/03/17/myth-busting-the-economy-drives-the-stock-market/](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2023/03/17/myth-busting-the-economy-drives-the-stock-market/) Diversification is an insurance policy and reduces risk. A diversified portfolio has a better expected return long term.

Look at it this way. Don't even separate them by the country in which they are headquartered. Just look at a top down list of ALL tradable stocks on the world's open market. They have a never-ending list (lets just call it thousands) of factors to consider for each individual company. Only a small portion of those factors (some of which you listed) are determined by their geographical location. If it's in the US, they're positive markers. If they're outside of the US, they COULD be negative markers. But why are these few factors enough to completely exclude all of these stocks? The market deems their worth in the price, after considering ALL factors, and you should respect that worth, regardless of which land they reside on.

You perhaps misunderstand what I mean when I talk about the ""risk"" of buying 1 single country. I'm talking about potential decades-long protracted bear markets, not sudden crashes with quick recoveries like March 2020.

For example, if VXUS is held in a retirement account the foreign tax credit is lost.  The credit varies slightly year to year but for VXUS it tends to be around 8.5% as shown here:  https://personal1.vanguard.com/pdf/FTC_2023.pdf

VXUS has a current dividend yield of 3.21% according to Morningstar:  https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/vxus/quote

The lost foreign tax credit therefore reduces returns by 27 basis points (8.5% x 321).  

For a $1 million dollar portfolio that translates to $2700 each year.  

That’s real money. 

And tax costs could be substantially higher than this in taxable accounts for high-income earners due to the high dividend yield and large percentage of non-qualified dividends in VXUS.   This is particularly true for high-income earners who live in states that also have high income taxes like CA, NY, NJ, and HI where the top rate is over 10%.  Those investors could be paying a 50% tax on their non-qualified dividends.

My take is that even if China is on a downswing, it's only 6.7% of VXUS.  If I hold 30% international, sure I'm exposed to China but the entire country comprises only 2% of my assets.

Something else I consider, VWO and VXUS are automatically balanced between countries as they grow and shrink over time, so if China does poorly for a few years, it's percentage relative to others will decrease.  I'm buying a smaller portion, and at a lower price relative to when it was higher, in essence buying low.
